🧠 Cognitive Mirror
GenAI Preventive Intelligence System

Cognitive Mirror is a Generative AI–powered preventive intelligence system that analyzes multi-day behavioral patterns to detect early cognitive imbalance before visible symptoms escalate.

Unlike reactive health assistants, Cognitive Mirror focuses on early awareness through behavioral trend analysis, explainable AI reasoning, and adaptive micro-interventions.

🚀 Problem Statement

Stress, burnout, and lifestyle imbalance develop gradually through subtle behavioral shifts. Most systems react only after symptoms appear.

Cognitive Mirror aims to shift from reactive monitoring to preventive intelligence by identifying early risk signals using behavioral analytics and Generative AI.

🏗 System Architecture

The system consists of the following layers:

Signal Input Layer

Sleep hours

Stress level

Focus level

Daily reflection text

Trend & Acceleration Engine

Detects increasing/decreasing behavioral trends

Identifies stress acceleration

Tracks multi-day patterns

Risk Scoring Engine

Classifies risk as Low / Moderate / High

Computes Cognitive Stability Index (0–100)

GenAI Reasoning Core (Gemini API)

Interprets structured behavioral data

Generates explainable preventive insights

Suggests adaptive micro-interventions

Adaptive Intervention Engine

Personalized recommendations

Preventive actions based on risk level

Predictive Warning Layer

Detects projected high-risk trajectory

Early burnout detection logic
