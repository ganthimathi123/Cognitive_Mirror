# 🧠 Cognitive Mirror  
## GenAI Preventive Intelligence System

Cognitive Mirror is a Generative AI–powered preventive intelligence system that analyzes multi-day behavioral patterns to detect early cognitive imbalance before visible symptoms escalate.

Unlike reactive health assistants, Cognitive Mirror focuses on early awareness through behavioral trend analysis, explainable AI reasoning, and adaptive micro-interventions.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Stress, burnout, and lifestyle imbalance develop gradually through subtle behavioral shifts. Most systems react only after symptoms appear.

Cognitive Mirror shifts from reactive monitoring to preventive intelligence by identifying early risk signals using behavioral analytics and Generative AI.

## 🏗 System Architecture

### 1️⃣ Signal Input Layer
- Sleep hours  
- Stress level  
- Focus level  
- Daily reflection text  

### 2️⃣ Trend & Acceleration Engine
- Detects increasing/decreasing behavioral trends  
- Identifies stress acceleration  
- Tracks multi-day patterns  

### 3️⃣ Risk Scoring Engine
- Classifies risk as **Low / Moderate / High**  
- Computes **Cognitive Stability Index (0–100)**  

### 4️⃣ GenAI Reasoning Core (Gemini API)
- Interprets structured behavioral data  
- Generates explainable preventive insights  
- Suggests adaptive micro-interventions  

### 5️⃣ Adaptive Intervention Engine
- Personalized recommendations  
- Preventive actions based on risk level  

### 6️⃣ Predictive Warning Layer
- Detects projected high-risk trajectory  
- Early burnout detection logic
